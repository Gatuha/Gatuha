- The notebook focuses on Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning paradigm where the model learns by exploring an environment, making decisions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. Unlike traditional supervised learning, reinforcement learning doesn't rely on a predefined dataset but allows the model to generate its own examples through interaction with the environment.

Terminology:
The notebook introduces key concepts in reinforcement learning:

    Environment: The space in which the agent operates, such as a level in a game.
    Agent: The entity exploring the environment and taking actions.
    State: The current situation or configuration of the agent in the environment.
    Action: Interactions the agent performs in the environment.
    Reward: The feedback received by the agent after each action, guiding it toward the goal.

Q-Learning:
The notebook delves into Q-Learning, a specific reinforcement learning technique. Q-Learning involves creating a Q-Table (or Q-Matrix), a matrix of action-reward values. The algorithm updates this matrix based on the rewards obtained during exploration. After training, the Q-Table guides the agent to make optimal decisions in any state.

Learning the Q-Table:
The notebook explains the process of updating the Q-Table. The agent explores the environment, takes actions, records states and rewards, and uses this information to update the Q-Table iteratively. The learning process involves balancing random exploration and learned values.

Q-Values Update Formula:
The notebook provides the formula for updating Q-Table values after each action, considering the reward, learning rate (α), and discount factor (γ).

Q-Learning Example:
An example scenario is presented using the OpenAI Gym's FrozenLake environment. The notebook demonstrates how to initialize a Q-Table, set constants, pick actions, and update Q-Values through the Q-Learning algorithm. The code is implemented using Python and Gym.

Constants:
Important constants like the number of episodes, maximum steps, learning rate, and discount factor are defined.

Picking an Action:
The notebook introduces the concept of epsilon, controlling the probability of choosing a random action versus using the Q-Table to pick the best action.

Putting it Together:
The Q-Learning algorithm is assembled, combining the defined elements into a cohesive code. The implementation is run for a specified number of episodes.

Results:
The notebook concludes by displaying the learned Q-Table and the average reward achieved during training. It also includes a plot showing the progress of the agent's average reward over episodes.
